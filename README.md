Universal Audio Sync: Performance Validation Data

Problem Statement

Real-time audio systems face a fundamental dilemma:

Small buffers → low latency, but prone to jitter and audible dropouts.

Large buffers → stability, but unacceptable latency for interactive use.

This trade-off has long limited performance in conferencing, gaming, and professional audio.

Approach

We conducted controlled validation tests of a new software-based synchronization method designed to stabilize real-time buffered streams under drift stress.

The method is treated as a black-box system: input = asynchronous audio clocks with deliberate drift, output = observable queue depth, latency, and error events.

Test Conditions

Buffer target: 144 frames (~3.0 ms)

Drift stress: ±80 ppm clock mismatch

Duration: 5 minutes continuous run (for this demo)

Telemetry recorded: buffer depth, corrections, underrun/overrun counts

Key Results

Latency stability: >99.99% of samples held within ±1 frame of the target

Jitter elimination: correction intervals evenly spaced with <1% variance

Robustness: Zero underruns (xruns) despite continuous drift stress

Accuracy: Cumulative corrections slope exactly matched injected drift

Data Files

Conclusion

The results demonstrate a stable, low-latency, jitter-free audio pipeline under realistic stress. Unlike conventional approaches (oversized buffers, resampling, hardware ASRC), this method maintains interactive latency with uncompromising stability.

How to Interpret the Results:

Queue Depth Plot: Stays essentially flat around the 144-frame target. Small spikes visible in the graph are logging artifacts only; raw telemetry confirms stability.

Correction Interval Histogram: Shows corrections are evenly spaced (<1% variance). This demonstrates inaudibility — no clustering or bursts.

Cumulative Corrections Plot: Straight line slope matches injected drift, proving precise long-term synchronization.

Overrun/Underrun Counters: Zero underruns occurred in the entire test, confirming stability at 3 ms latency.

Note: The underlying synchronization technique is proprietary. This repository contains results only for validation purposes.
