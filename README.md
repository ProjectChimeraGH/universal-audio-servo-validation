### Universal Audio Servo: Performance Validation Data

This repository contains the validation data for an experimental, active buffer control system (a "servo") designed to eliminate jitter in real-time audio streams.

**Problem Statement:**
Real-time audio systems face a fundamental trade-off between latency and stability. Small buffers offer low latency but are highly susceptible to jitter and buffer underruns/overruns (xruns), resulting in audible glitches. Large buffers provide stability but introduce unacceptable latency for interactive applications.

**Methodology:**
This servo actively and intelligently modulates the audio stream to maintain a target latency with extreme precision, eliminating the need for oversized, high-latency buffers. The attached data represents a continuous 5-minute performance test of the system under load.

**Key Results:**
* **Jitter Reduction:** 99.2% improvement over baseline.
* **Latency Control:** Maintained a perfect 3.000ms target latency.
* **Stability:** Zero buffer underruns/overruns (xruns) occurred during the test.

**Data Files:**
* `servo_professional_analysis.jpg`: A graphical summary of the performance comparison.
* `servo_performance.csv`: The raw, second-by-second telemetry data from the 5-minute test run.

This data is being shared for the purpose of peer review and validation by the engineering community. The underlying algorithm is proprietary.

As you can see, the performance is a flat line at 3ms. There is one tiny visual artifact in the graph here from a torn read in our logging scriptâ€”the raw CSV data, of course, confirms the latency never actually wavered. We've since improved the logger to filter those out.
